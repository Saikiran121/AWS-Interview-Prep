01. A company’s CRM application runs on an Auto Scaling group of On-Demand EC2 instances. Users report slow performance at the start of 
    the workday, but it normalizes after a few hours. What is the MOST operationally efficient solution?
    A) Dynamic scaling based on CPU utilization
    B) Dynamic scaling based on memory utilization
    C) Scheduled scaling to launch new instances before the workday
    D) Predictive scaling to adjust instance count automatically

    Answer: Scheduled scaling to launch new instances before the start of the day.
    Explanation: Scheduled scaling ensures the application has enough capacity before peak usage, addressing the performance lag at startup 
    efficiently


02. What method detects when to replace an EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling group?
    A) Health check
    B) Load balancing algorithm
    C) EC2 health check
    D) Dynamic path detection

    Answer: Health Check
    Explanation: Auto Scaling uses health checks (EC2 and optionally ELB) to determine if an instance is unhealthy and should be replaced.


03. What are two characteristics of an Amazon EC2 security group? (Choose two)
    A) Instance-level packet filtering
    B) Deny rules only
    C) Permit rules only
    D) Subnet-level packet filtering
    E) Inbound only

    Answer: A) Instance-level packet filtering and C) Permit rules only
    Explanation: Security groups act at the instance level and are stateful, with only allow (permit) rules; there are no explicit deny rules.


04. A company requires high availability for an EC2 instance. Which approach allows automatic failover with minimal changes?
    A) Modify the application to store data on instance store.
    B) Attach a secondary elastic network interface (ENI) to the EC2 instance and move it to a standby instance if the primary fails.
    C) Use EC2 Auto Scaling with health checks.
    D) Associate an Elastic IP address with the primary instance’s network interface, and move it to a standby instance upon failure.

    Answer: Associate an Elastic IP address with the primary instance’s network interface, and move it to a standby instance upon failure.
    Explanation: Elastic IPs allow you to quickly redirect traffic to a standby EC2 instance in case of failure.


05. What are the DHCP option attributes used to assign private DNS servers to your VPC?
    A) DNS resolution and domain name
    B) Hostnames and internet domain
    C) Domain servers and domain name

    B) Copy data to instance store.
    C) Use S3 Transfer Acceleration.
    D) Enable CloudTrail logging.
    
    Answer: Create a snapshot of the EBS volume attached to the instance.
    Explanation: EBS snapshots are the standard method for backing up EC2 instance data.


08. A company’s voting system runs on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, but the RDS database can’t keep up with the write requests. What is 
    the most efficient solution?
    A) Migrate the front-end application to AWS Lambda and use API Gateway.
    B) Introduce an SQS queue between the EC2 instances and the database to buffer writes.
    C) Increase the size of the RDS instance.
    D) Use DynamoDB instead of RDS.

    Answer:  Introduce an SQS queue between the EC2 instances and the database to buffer writes.
    Explanation: Decoupling with SQS allows the system to handle bursts and smooth database writes, improving efficiency and scalability.


09. What is the benefit of using Spot Instances for EC2 workloads?
    A) Guaranteed uptime
    B) Lower cost for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
    C) Reserved capacity
    D) Persistent storage

    Answer: Lower cost for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
    Explanation: Spot Instances offer significant cost savings for workloads that can tolerate interruptions


10. How should you securely provide EC2 instances access to S3 buckets?
    A) Store AWS credentials on the instance.
    B) Use an IAM role attached to the EC2 instance.
    C) Use access keys in application code.
    D) Enable public access on the S3 bucket.

    Answer: Use an IAM role attached to the EC2 instance.
    Explanation: IAM roles provide secure, temporary credentials for EC2 instances to access AWS resources without hardcoding credentials.


11. A company runs a web application on a single EC2 instance with user-uploaded documents stored on an EBS volume. For scalability, they add a 
    second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another AZ, both behind an Application Load Balancer. Users now see only some of their documents 
    depending on which instance serves their request. What should you do?
    - Store the documents on Amazon S3 and update the application to use S3 for document storage, ensuring all instances access the same data.


12. A company wants to migrate 70 TB of large video files from on-premises NFS to Amazon S3, minimizing network bandwidth usage. What’s the best 
    solution?
    - Use AWS Snowball to physically transfer the data to S3, reducing network bandwidth usage


13. A company’s application ingests messages at unpredictable rates, sometimes up to 100,000 per second, and must decouple producers and consumers 
    for scalability. What AWS service should you use?
    - Use Amazon SQS to decouple the components and handle variable workloads


14. A company’s application tier EC2 instances in private subnets need to download software patches from the internet but can’t be directly 
    accessible. What should you do? (Select TWO)
    - A) Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet.
      B) Associate a custom route table with a route to the NAT gateway for the private subnets.

    What’s the most cost-effective way to add capacity?
    - Deploy On-Demand Instances during periods of high demand


16. A web application in an Auto Scaling group experiences slow performance at the start of the business day. What is the most operationally 
    efficient solution?
    - Configure a Scheduled scaling policy to launch new instances before the start of the day
