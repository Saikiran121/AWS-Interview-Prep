01. Explain the difference between EC2 root device volumes backed by EBS and instance store.
    - The root device volume contains the image used to boot the instance. If it's EBS-backed, the data persists after stopping or terminating the 
      instance. If it's instance store-backed, the data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.


02. Describe the differences between On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot Instances.
    - On-Demand: Pay for compute by the hour/second with no long-term commitment.
    - Reserved: Commit to a specific instance type and region for 1 or 3 years in exchange for a discount.
    - Spot: Use spare AWS capacity at reduced prices, but instances can be interrupted by AWS


03. What are the main categories of EC2 instance types, and what are their use cases?
    - General Purpose: Balanced resources, suitable for most workloads.
    - Compute Optimized: For CPU-intensive tasks.
    - Memory Optimized: For memory-heavy applications.
    - Storage Optimized: For high disk throughput.
    - Accelerated Computing: For GPU or hardware accelerator needs.


04. How can you launch an EC2 instance with a specific private IP address?
    - By launching the instance within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you can specify the private IP address


05. What are security best practices for EC2?
    - Use IAM roles for access management
    - Restrict access to trusted hosts
    - Minimize permissions
    - Disable password-based logins
    - Implement multi-factor authentication


06. What is a security group, and how does it differ from a network ACL?
    - Security groups act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic. Network ACLs operate at the subnet 
      level and provide stateless filtering.


07. How would you handle CPU utilization exceeding 80% on an EC2 instance running your application?
    - Set up an Auto Scaling Group to launch additional instances when CPU exceeds the threshold, and use an Application Load Balancer to 
      distribute traffic among instances.


08. How do you design a highly available EC2 architecture?
    - Deploy instances across multiple Availability Zones
    - Use Elastic Load Balancers
    - Implement Auto Scaling
    - Regularly back up data and use monitoring tools like CloudWatch


09. What are EBS Snapshots and how do you use them?
    - EBS Snapshots are point-in-time backups of EBS volumes. They can be used to restore data or create new volumes, ensuring data durability


10. How do you ensure data durability and ACID compliance for a web application using EC2 and EBS?
    - Use Amazon EFS for shared storage, deploy instances in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones, and store critical data on 
      EFS or EBS with regular snapshots


11. How would you ensure multi-region redundancy for EC2 workloads?
    - Deploy EC2 instances in multiple regions, use Route 53 for DNS routing, and replicate data using S3 Cross-Region Replication. Consider 
      active-active or active-passive failover strategies


12. What steps would you take if an EC2 instance is unreachable via SSH?
    - Check security group and network ACL rules
    - Verify the instanceâ€™s public IP and key pair
    - Ensure the instance is running and healthy
    - Review VPC route tables and subnet settings

------------------------------------------------------------

13. Explain how you would design a highly available, fault-tolerant web application using EC2.
    - Deploy EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones within a Region.
    - Use Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic.
    - Place application servers in Auto Scaling Groups for automatic scaling and recovery.
    - Store persistent data in Multi-AZ RDS or DynamoDB.
    - Use S3 for static content and CloudFront for global content delivery.
    - Secure each tier with appropriate security groups and VPC subnets


14. What is a multi-tier architecture on AWS, and how do you implement it with EC2?
    - A multi-tier (three-tier) architecture separates the application into Presentation, Logic, and Data layers.
        a. Presentation Tier: Use ELB, CloudFront, and public subnets for web servers.
        b. Logic Tier: Place EC2 instances or Lambda in private subnets, managed by Auto Scaling Groups.
        c. Data Tier: Use RDS/DynamoDB/S3 in private subnets, with Multi-AZ for redundancy.
    - Secure each tier with dedicated security groups and restrict access between tiers


15. How would you implement a microservices architecture using EC2 and other AWS services?
    - Deploy each microservice on separate EC2 instances, ECS, or EKS for container orchestration.
    - Use Application Load Balancer for path-based routing.
    - Implement service discovery with AWS Cloud Map.
    - Secure inter-service communication with security groups and IAM.
    - Use circuit breaker patterns to improve resilience and avoid cascading failures


16. How do you achieve zero-downtime deployments with EC2?
    - Use Auto Scaling Groups with multiple instances.
    - Deploy new versions using rolling updates or blue/green deployments.
    - Route traffic using ELB and gradually shift traffic to new instances.
    - Monitor health checks and automate rollback if failures occur


15. Describe how you would set up auto-scaling for unpredictable workloads.
    - Define scaling policies based on CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, custom metrics).
    - Set up step or target tracking scaling policies for rapid response.
    - Use warm-up settings to prevent premature scaling.
    - Combine with Spot Instances for cost optimization


16. You need to migrate an on-premises application to AWS EC2 with minimal downtime. How do you proceed?
    - Use AWS Application Migration Service or create AMIs from on-premises VMs.
    - Sync data using AWS DataSync or S3.
    - Test cutover in a staging environment.
    - Plan a DNS switch-over during a low-traffic window.


17. How would you secure communication between EC2 instances across different VPCs?
    - Use VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway.
    - Implement security group rules to allow specific traffic.
    - Use VPN or AWS PrivateLink for sensitive workloads.
