01. What is Amazon EC2 and what are its core features?
    - Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to launch and manage virtual servers 
      (instances) with flexible configurations.
    
    - Features 
        a. On-demand scalability
        b. various instance types
        c. support for persistent and ephemeral storage
        d. security groups
        e. key pairs
        f. integration with other AWS Services 


02. How do you launch and connect to an EC2 Instance?
    - You can launch EC2 instance via tha AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK by selecting an AMI, instance type, and configuring network and 
      storage. 
    - Connect using SSH for Linux or RDP for Windows, using the appropriate key pair.


03. What information can you view and manage from the EC2 Dashboard?
    - The EC2 Dashboard provides an overview of all your EC2 resources, including running instances, volumes, snapshots, Elastic IPs, and 
      Security Groups. It allows you to monitor resource usage and status across all regions.


04. How does EC2 Global View help in multi-region management?
    - EC2 Global View allows you to see and manage EC2 resources across all AWS regions from a single pane, making it easier to monitor and operate 
      global deployments.


05. What is an EC2 instance and how do instance types differ?
    - An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. Instance types differ by CPU, memory, storage, network performance, and sometimes
      GPU capabilities, allowing you to choose the optimal configuration for your workload.


06. How do you select the right EC2 instance type for your application?
    - Choose based on workload requirements: compute-optimized for CPU heavy tasks, memory-optimized for large datasets, storage-optimized
      for high IOPS, and GPU instances for ML or graphic workloads.


07. What are EC2 Launch Templates and why use them?
    - Launch Templates lets you define configuration parameters (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, etc). For launching instances,
      promoting consistency and automation in deployments.


08. What are Spot Instances and when should you use them?
    - Spot Instances let you bid on unused EC2 capacity at reduced prices, suitable for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads. They can 
      interrupted by AWS with 2 minute's notice. 


09. How do Reserved Instances and Savings Plans differ?
    - Reserved instances provide a discount for commiting to a specific Instance type and region over 1 or 3 years.
    - Savings plans offer more felxibility, applying discounts to any usage that matches the plans parameters.


10. What are Dedicated Hosts and Capacity Reservations?
    - Dedicated Hosts provide physical servers dedicated to your use, useful for licensing or compliance needs.
    - Capacity Reservations ensure that you have guaranteed instance capacity in a specific AZ.


11. What is an AMI and how is it used?
    - An Amazon Machine Image(AMI) is a template containing an OS and software configuration used to launch EC2 instances. You can create 
      custom AMIs for rapid, consistent deployments


12. What is Amazon EBS and how does it differ from instance store?
    - Amazon EBS provides persistent block storage that survives instance stops and terminations. 
    - Instance store is ephemeral and data is lost when the instance stops or terminates.


13. How do you back up and restore an EC2 instance using EBS Snapshots?
    - Take EBS snapshots for backup. To restore, create a new volume from the snapshot and attach it to the instance.


14. What is the EBS Lifecycle Manager?
    - It automates the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots, helping you manage backups and comply with data retention policies.


15. What are Security Groups and how do they work?
    - Security Groups acts as virtual firewalls, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances by specifying allowed protocols,
      ports, and IP ranges.


16. What are Elastic IPs and when should you use them?
    - Elastic IPs are static public IP addresses for dynamic cloud computing. Use them when you need a persistent IP for your instance, 
      even if it is stopped or replaced.


17. What are Placement Groups?
    - Placement Groups determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware: Cluster (low latency), Spread (high availability),
      Partition (fault tolerance).


18. How do Key Pairs secure EC2 instances?
    - Key Pairs (public/private SSH Keys) are used for secure login to instances. AWS Stores the public key; you must keep the private
      key safe.


19. What are Network Interfaces?
    - Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs) are virtual network cards attached to instances, supporting multiple IPs, security groups,
      and network configurations.


20. What is the purpose of Load Balancers in EC2?
    - Load Balancers distribute incomming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, improving availability and scalability. AWS Provides
      Application, Network and Classic Load Balancers.


21. What are Target Groups?
    - Target Groups are used by Load Balancers to route traffic to specific sets of instances or containers, supporting health checks and routing 
      rules.


22. What are Trust Stores?
    - Trust Stores manage SSL/TLS certificates and trusted CAs for secure communication in load balancing scenarios.


23. What is Auto Scaling and how does it work with EC2?
    - Auto Scaling automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to demand, using policies based on metrics like CPU utilization. 
      It helps optimize cost and performance


24. What is an Auto Scaling Group?
    - An Auto Scaling Group is a collection of EC2 instances managed together for scaling and health checks, ensuring desired capacity and 
      availability.


25. How do you monitor EC2 instances?
    - Use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and visualize metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network), set alarms, and automate actions like scaling or 
      notifications


26. How can you optimize EC2 costs?
    - Use rightsizing recommendations, monitor usage, leverage Spot Instances, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances, and automate instance 
      lifecycle management


27. How do you troubleshoot connectivity issues for an EC2 instance?
    - Check security group and network ACL rules, subnet routing, instance status, and ensure the correct key pair and Elastic IP are used


28. How do you prevent accidental termination of an EC2 instance?
    - Enable termination protection on the instance settings


29. How do you migrate an EC2 instance to another region?
    - Create an AMI or snapshot, copy it to the target region, and launch a new instance from it


30. How do you ensure high availability for EC2 workloads?
    - Deploy instances across multiple Availability Zones, use Elastic Load Balancers, Auto Scaling Groups, and monitor with CloudWatch
