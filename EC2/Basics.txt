01. What is Amazon EC2 and what are its core features?
    - Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to launch and manage virtual servers 
      (instances) with flexible configurations.
    
    - Features 
        a. On-demand scalability
        b. various instance types
        c. support for persistent and ephemeral storage
        d. security groups
        e. key pairs
        f. integration with other AWS Services 


02. How do you launch and connect to an EC2 Instance?
    - You can launch EC2 instance via tha AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK by selecting an AMI, instance type, and configuring network and 
      storage. 
    - Connect using SSH for Linux or RDP for Windows, using the appropriate key pair.


03. What information can you view and manage from the EC2 Dashboard?
    - The EC2 Dashboard provides an overview of all your EC2 resources, including running instances, volumes, snapshots, Elastic IPs, and 
      Security Groups. It allows you to monitor resource usage and status across all regions.


04. How does EC2 Global View help in multi-region management?
    - EC2 Global View allows you to see and manage EC2 resources across all AWS regions from a single pane, making it easier to monitor and operate 
      global deployments.


05. What is an EC2 instance and how do instance types differ?
    - An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS cloud. Instance types differ by CPU, memory, storage, network performance, and sometimes
      GPU capabilities, allowing you to choose the optimal configuration for your workload.


06. How do you select the right EC2 instance type for your application?
    - Choose based on workload requirements: compute-optimized for CPU heavy tasks, memory-optimized for large datasets, storage-optimized
      for high IOPS, and GPU instances for ML or graphic workloads.
