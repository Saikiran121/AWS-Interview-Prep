01. You need to launch a Linux EC2 instance for a web application. How will you ensure only your team can SSH into the server?
    - Create a security group allowing inbound SSH (port 22) only from your team’s IP range, and associate it with the instance. Use a unique 
      key pair for secure access.


02. You notice your EC2 instance’s root EBS volume is running out of space. What’s your approach to increase storage?
    - Stop the instance, take a snapshot of the root volume, create a larger EBS volume from the snapshot, attach it as the root device, and 
      resize the filesystem after booting


03. Your application on EC2 needs to send emails reliably. Which AWS service should you use?
    - Use Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) for scalable, cost-effective, and reliable email sending


04. You want to automate the installation of Apache on every new EC2 instance at launch. How can you achieve this?
    - Use EC2 user data to provide a shell script that installs Apache during instance initialization


05. Your EC2 instance must access an S3 bucket securely. What is the best practice?
    - Attach an IAM role to the instance with permissions to access the S3 bucket, avoiding hardcoded credentials


06. You need to back up data from your EC2 instance regularly. What’s the simplest AWS-native way?
    - Schedule EBS snapshots using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager for automated backups


07. You want to monitor CPU utilization on your EC2 instances. What AWS service do you use?
    - Use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and visualize CPU metrics, and set up alarms if thresholds are crossed


08. A web server running on EC2 must be accessible over HTTP and HTTPS. How do you configure this?
    - Add inbound rules to the security group for ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)


09. You need to ensure your EC2 instance retains its public IP after a restart. What do you do?
    - Allocate and associate an Elastic IP address with the instance


10. How do you minimize cost for a development EC2 instance that is only needed during business hours?
    - Automate stopping the instance outside business hours using Lambda or AWS Instance Scheduler


------------------

11. Your web app on EC2 is experiencing high CPU spikes during traffic surges. What’s your scaling strategy?
    - Place instances in an Auto Scaling group with policies to launch new instances when CPU exceeds a threshold, and use an Application Load 
      Balancer to distribute traffic


12. You’re tasked with moving a running EC2 instance to a different Availability Zone. What’s your approach?
    - Create an AMI or snapshot of the instance, launch a new instance in the target AZ from that AMI, and update DNS or Elastic IP as needed


13. You need to provide shared, POSIX-compliant storage for multiple EC2 instances. What AWS service do you use?
    - Use Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) for scalable, shared file storage across instances


14. You want to ensure EC2 instances in a private subnet can access the internet for updates. How do you set this up?
    - Deploy a NAT Gateway in a public subnet and update the private subnet’s route table to point internet-bound traffic to the NAT Gateway


15. A batch job runs on EC2 and can tolerate interruptions. How can you save costs?
    - Use Spot Instances for the batch job, as they are significantly cheaper and suitable for interruption-tolerant workloads


16. Your company wants to enforce that all EC2 instances have encrypted EBS volumes. How do you ensure compliance?
    - Use AWS Config rules to detect non-compliant instances and enforce EBS encryption by default


17. How do you recover quickly if your EC2 instance becomes unresponsive due to a failed application update?
    - Revert to a previous EBS snapshot or launch a new instance from a recent AMI backup


18. You want to restrict SSH access to EC2 instances to only a specific corporate VPN. How do you configure this?
    - Set the security group to allow SSH only from the VPN’s public IP address range


19. You need to migrate an EC2-based application to another AWS region with minimal downtime. What’s your process?
    - Create an AMI of the instance, copy it to the target region, launch a new instance from the AMI, and switch DNS or Elastic IP after validation


20. How do you ensure that your EC2 instances are always running the latest OS patches?
    - Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate patching across your fleet


------------------------------------

21. You must design a highly available, scalable web application using EC2. What’s your architecture?
    - Deploy EC2 instances in multiple AZs within an Auto Scaling group, fronted by an Application Load Balancer, and store session/data in Amazon 
      RDS or DynamoDB for durability and high availability


22. A microservices application needs to scale independently and support blue/green deployments. How do you design this on EC2?
    - Deploy each microservice in its own Auto Scaling group and target group behind an Application Load Balancer using path-based routing. Use 
      separate deployment pipelines for blue/green deployments


23. You need to ensure that sensitive data on EC2 volumes is always encrypted, including backups and snapshots. How do you enforce this?
    - Enable EBS encryption by default, use KMS-managed keys, and ensure snapshots are encrypted. Use IAM policies and AWS Config to audit 
      compliance


24. Your EC2-based application must withstand AZ failures without downtime. What’s your design?
    - Deploy instances across multiple AZs, use an Auto Scaling group and an Elastic Load Balancer, and ensure data is stored in Multi-AZ 
      services (e.g., RDS Multi-AZ, S3)


25. You must migrate a legacy on-premises application to EC2 with minimal downtime. What’s your approach?
    - Use AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) for lift-and-shift migration, perform testing in AWS, and schedule a final cutover during a 
      low-traffic window


26. A critical EC2 workload needs to meet strict RTO/RPO requirements. What’s your DR strategy?
    - Implement cross-region AMI and snapshot replication, automate failover with CloudFormation or Elastic Disaster Recovery, and use Route 53 
      for DNS failover


27. You need to analyze and troubleshoot intermittent network connectivity issues on EC2. What AWS tools do you use?
    - Use VPC Flow Logs for traffic analysis, CloudWatch for metrics, and AWS Systems Manager for instance-level diagnostics


28. A regulated workload requires all EC2 activity to be auditable. How do you ensure compliance?
    - Enable AWS CloudTrail for API logging, configure CloudWatch Logs for OS-level events, and use AWS Config for resource compliance tracking


29. You want to optimize costs for a large EC2 fleet running mixed workloads (steady, burst, batch). What’s your approach?
    - Use a blend of Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for steady workloads, On-Demand for unpredictable needs, and Spot Instances for 
      batch/fault-tolerant jobs. Use Auto Scaling to manage instance types and counts


30. A global web app on EC2 must deliver low latency to users worldwide. What AWS services and architecture do you use?
    - Deploy EC2 instances in multiple regions, use Route 53 latency-based routing, front-end with CloudFront CDN, and replicate data using S3 
      Cross-Region Replication or DynamoDB Global Tables
