01. A developer needs access to a specific S3 bucket but should not be able to delete objects. How do you achieve this?
    - Attach a custom IAM policy to the developer’s user or group that allows s3:GetObject and s3:PutObject for that bucket, but does not 
      include s3:DeleteObject. This enforces least privilege.


02. You want to allow an EC2 instance to access an S3 bucket without using access keys. What’s the best approach?
    - Assign an IAM role with the necessary S3 permissions to the EC2 instance. The instance will use the role’s temporary credentials to 
      access S3 securely


03. How can you grant temporary access to a consultant for 7 days to access a DynamoDB table?
    - Create an IAM role with required DynamoDB permissions. Use AWS STS to generate temporary credentials for the consultant, 
      specifying a session duration of up to 7 days.


04. A user needs read-only access to all AWS services. What’s the simplest way to grant this?
    - Attach the AWS managed policy ReadOnlyAccess to the user or their group.


05. How would you enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users in your account?
    - Enable MFA for each IAM user and enforce MFA required policies, possibly using an AWS Config rule to ensure compliance.


06. How do you allow users from your company’s Active Directory to access the AWS Console without creating IAM users for each?
    - Configure identity federation using SAML with AWS IAM roles, allowing users to assume roles after authenticating via Active Directory


07. You want to restrict a developer to launch only t2.micro EC2 instances. How do you enforce this?
    - Attach a policy to the developer that allows ec2:RunInstances only with a condition specifying the InstanceType as t2.micro


08. How do you audit which IAM users have not used their credentials in the last 90 days?
    - Generate and review the IAM Credential Report, which shows last-used information for passwords and access keys


09. What is the best way to provide cross-account access to an S3 bucket?
    - Create an IAM role in the target account with S3 permissions and allow the source account’s users to assume that role. Alternatively, use 
      an S3 bucket policy granting access to the source account’s principals.


10. How can you enforce the principle of least privilege in your IAM policies?
    - Grant only the specific permissions required for each user, group, or role, regularly review and remove unnecessary permissions, and use 
      IAM Access Advisor to audit usage
