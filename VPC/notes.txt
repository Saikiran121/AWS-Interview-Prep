01. What is AWS VPC?
    - Amazone VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources
      (like EC2) in a custom-defined network.
    
    - Its your own private datacenter in AWS with complete control over IP ranges, subnets, route tables and security settings.

02. What is CIDR blocks?
    - IP Address range for your VPC in CIDR notation (eg: 10.0.0.0/16)
    - Can range between /16 and /28

03. Subnets 
    - Divide your VPC CIDR block into smaller subnets
    - Public Subnet: Has route to internet via IGW
    - Private Subnet: No direct route to internet.

04. Route table
    - Control traffic routing within the VPC.
    - Each subnet must be associated with one route table

05. Internet Gateway 
    - Allows instances in public subnets to access the internet.

06. NAT Gateway / NAT Instances 
    - Allows Private Subnet instances to initiate outbound traffic to the internet.

07. Elastic IP 
    - Static public IP address that can be attached to instances or NAT Gateways.

08. Security Groups 
    - Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
    - Operate at the instance level. 

09. Network ACLs (NACLs)
    - Firewall at the subnet levels 
    - stateless: inbound/outbound rules must be explicitly defined.

10. VPC Peering 
    - Connects two VPCs privately, across accounts or regions.

11. Endpoints (Gateway & Interface)
    - Private connection between VPC and AWS Services (S3, DynamoDB etc.)

12. Bastion Host (Jump Server)
    - A Bastion Host (also known as Jump Server) is a special-purpose server used to provide controlled access to private network resources
      (such as EC2 instances in private subnet) from an external network like the internet
    
    a. What is Bastion Host?
        - A Bastion Host is a Hardened server that acts as a Gateway between a secure private network (like VPC private subnet) and the internet
        - It is typically deployed in a public subnet with a public IP address and strict access controls.
        - Once connected to a Bastion Host, you can SSH into private instances within the VPC.
    
    b. Use Cases 
        1. Secure SSH Access to Private EC2s
            - Allows devs/admins to connect to private servers without exposing them directly to the internet.
        
        2. Debugging and Troubleshooting 
            - Safely access private environments to investigate the issue 
        
        3. Audit and Monitoring
            - All access passes through one Gateway, allowing easy Monitoring/logging.
        
        4. Multi-layered Security
            - Acts as a checkpoint to prevent direct exposure of the internal resources.
        
        5. Hybrid environments
            - In hybrid clouds, it can serve as a bridge to on-prem resources via VPN/Direct connect

Notes:

01. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
    - A VPC is a customizable, logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can define your own IP address range, subnets, 
      route tables, and gateways.
    - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.


02. Your VPCs
    - Lists all VPCs in your account, their CIDR blocks, and associated resources.
    - You can create, modify, or delete VPCs as needed.


03. Subnets 
    - Subnets divide your VPCâ€™s IP address range into smaller segments, each residing in a single Availability Zone
    - Public subnets have internet access (via Internet Gateway); private subnets do not.
    - Subnets are used for isolation, high availability, and environment segmentation (e.g., dev, prod)


04. Route Tables
    - Define how traffic is routed within your VPC
    - Main route table: default for all subnets unless explicitly associated with another.
    - Custom route tables: user-defined for specific routing needs.
    - Routes specify destination CIDR blocks and targets (e.g., gateways, network interfaces)


05. Internet Gateways
    - Enable communication between your VPC and the internet
    - Must be attached to the VPC and referenced in the route table for internet-bound traffic
    - No additional charge, but standard data transfer rates apply.


06. Egress-only Internet Gateways
    - Provide outbound-only internet access for IPv6 traffic from your VPC.


07. DHCP Option Sets
    - Configure domain name servers, NTP servers, and other DHCP options for instances in your VPC.


08. Elastic IPs
    - Static, public IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing.


09. Managed Prefix Lists
    - Centrally manage IP address ranges for use in VPC route tables and security groups.


10. NAT Gateways
    - Enable instances in private subnets to access the internet, while preventing inbound internet connections.


11. Peering Connections
    - Connect two VPCs for private traffic routing, even across AWS accounts or regions.


12. Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)
    - Stateless, subnet-level firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic.


13. Security Groups
    - Stateful, instance-level firewalls controlling traffic based on rules.


14. PrivateLink
    - Securely connect VPCs to AWS services or third-party SaaS without traversing the public internet.


15. Lattice
    - Advanced service networking for managing connectivity, security, and observability across VPCs and accounts.

    - Privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services without using an internet gateway or NAT.


17. Endpoint Services

18. Service Networks
    - Service networks group multiple services for easier management and policy enforcement.


19. Lattice 
    - Lattice services provide advanced service-to-service connectivity and security.


20. Resource Configurations and Gateways
    - Resource Gateways: Centralize and manage access to shared resources.
    - Target Groups: Used by load balancers to route traffic to registered targets (EC2, IPs, Lambda).


21. DNS Firewall
    - Protects VPC resources from malicious domains using rule groups and domain lists.


22. Network Firewall

    b. Virtual Private Gateways
        - AWS side of a VPN connection.

    c. Site-to-Site VPN Connections

    d. Client VPN Endpoints
        - Allow remote users to securely access resources in your VPC.
