01. What is AWS VPC?
    - Amazone VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources
      (like EC2) in a custom-defined network.
    
    - Its your own private datacenter in AWS with complete control over IP ranges, subnets, route tables and security settings.

02. What is CIDR blocks?
    - IP Address range for your VPC in CIDR notation (eg: 10.0.0.0/16)
    - Can range between /16 and /28

03. Subnets 
    - Divide your VPC CIDR block into smaller subnets
    - Public Subnet: Has route to internet via IGW
    - Private Subnet: No direct route to internet.

04. Route table
    - Control traffic routing within the VPC.
    - Each subnet must be associated with one route table

05. Internet Gateway 
    - Allows instances in public subnets to access the internet.

06. NAT Gateway / NAT Instances 
    - Allows Private Subnet instances to initiate outbound traffic to the internet.

07. Elastic IP 
    - Static public IP address that can be attached to instances or NAT Gateways.

08. Security Groups 
    - Virtual firewalls for EC2 instances.
    - Operate at the instance level. 

09. Network ACLs (NACLs)
    - Firewall at the subnet levels 
    - stateless: inbound/outbound rules must be explicitly defined.

10. VPC Peering 
    - Connects two VPCs privately, across accounts or regions.

11. Endpoints (Gateway & Interface)
    - Private connection between VPC and AWS Services (S3, DynamoDB etc.)

12. Bastion Host (Jump Server)
    - A Bastion Host (also known as Jump Server) is a special-purpose server used to provide controlled access to private network resources
      (such as EC2 instances in private subnet) from an external network like the internet
    
    a. What is Bastion Host?
        - A Bastion Host is a Hardened server that acts as a Gateway between a secure private network (like VPC private subnet) and the internet
        - It is typically deployed in a public subnet with a public IP address and strict access controls.
        - Once connected to a Bastion Host, you can SSH into private instances within the VPC.
    
    b. Use Cases 
        1. Secure SSH Access to Private EC2s
            - Allows devs/admins to connect to private servers without exposing them directly to the internet.
        
        2. Debugging and Troubleshooting 
            - Safely access private environments to investigate the issue 
        
        3. Audit and Monitoring
            - All access passes through one Gateway, allowing easy Monitoring/logging.
        
        4. Multi-layered Security
            - Acts as a checkpoint to prevent direct exposure of the internal resources.
        
        5. Hybrid environments
            - In hybrid clouds, it can serve as a bridge to on-prem resources via VPN/Direct connect
