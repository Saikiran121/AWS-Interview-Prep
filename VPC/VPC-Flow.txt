Flow of Network Traffic in a Typical VPC Setup

01. Launching an EC2 instance in a subnet:
    - The instance gets a private IP from the subnetâ€™s IP range.


02. If the instance is in a public subnet:
    - It can have a public IP or Elastic IP.
    - Traffic destined for the internet is routed via the Internet Gateway (IGW).
    - Incoming internet traffic reaches the instance through the IGW.


03. If the instance is in a private subnet:
    - It has only a private IP.
    - To access the internet (for software updates, etc.), it sends traffic to the NAT Gateway in the public subnet.
    - The NAT Gateway forwards this traffic to the IGW and returns the response back to the instance.


04. Internal communication:
    - Instances within the same VPC or peered VPCs communicate directly using private IPs, routed by the route tables.
