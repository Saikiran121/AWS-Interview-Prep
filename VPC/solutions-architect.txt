01. What is Amazon VPC and why is it used?
    Answer: Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) lets you provision a logically isolated section of AWS where you can launch AWS resources in a 
    virtual network that you define, providing control over IP addressing, subnets, route tables, and security settings.


02. How do you design a fault-tolerant architecture using VPC?
    Answer: Use multiple Availability Zones with subnets in each AZ, deploy resources across these subnets, use Elastic Load Balancers for 
    distributing traffic, enable Auto Scaling, and configure route tables and gateways for redundancy.


03. What are subnets in a VPC?
    Answer: Subnets are subdivisions of a VPCâ€™s IP address range, each residing in a single Availability Zone, used to group resources and control 
    traffic flow.


04. Explain the difference between public and private subnets.
    Answer: Public subnets have a route to an Internet Gateway allowing inbound/outbound internet traffic; private subnets do not have direct 
    internet access and route outbound traffic through NAT gateways.


05. What is a NAT Gateway and when would you use it?
    Answer: NAT Gateway enables instances in private subnets to access the internet for updates or patches without exposing them to inbound 
    internet traffic.


06. How do Security Groups differ from Network ACLs?
    Answer: Security Groups are stateful firewalls at the instance level, automatically allowing return traffic; Network ACLs are stateless, 
    subnet-level firewalls requiring explicit inbound and outbound rules.


07. What is a VPC Endpoint?
    Answer: A VPC Endpoint allows private connections between your VPC and supported AWS services without using an Internet Gateway, improving 
    security and reducing latency.


08. What are the types of VPC Endpoints?
    Answer: Interface Endpoints (powered by AWS PrivateLink) and Gateway Endpoints (for S3 and DynamoDB).


09. How does VPC Peering work?
    Answer: VPC Peering connects two VPCs privately, enabling instances in either VPC to communicate using private IP addresses without traversing 
    the internet.


10. Can VPC Peering be established between VPCs in different AWS accounts?
    Answer: Yes, VPC Peering supports connections across different AWS accounts and regions.


11. What is a Transit Gateway and how does it differ from VPC Peering?
    Answer: Transit Gateway acts as a central hub connecting multiple VPCs, VPNs, and on-premises networks, simplifying management and scaling, 
    whereas VPC Peering is a one-to-one connection.


12. How do you monitor network traffic in a VPC?
    Answer: By enabling VPC Flow Logs, which capture metadata about IP traffic going to and from network interfaces.


13. What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance in a VPC?
    Answer: Stopping an instance shuts it down but preserves its EBS volumes and private IP; terminating deletes the instance and associated EBS 
    volumes (unless configured otherwise).


14. What is an Elastic IP and when would you use it?
    Answer: An Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address that can be associated with an instance or NAT Gateway to maintain a persistent public IP.


15. How do you secure communication between VPCs?
    Answer: Use VPC Peering, Transit Gateway, or AWS PrivateLink with proper routing and security group configurations.


16. What is the purpose of DHCP Option Sets in a VPC?
    Answer: DHCP Option Sets define network parameters like domain name servers and domain names for instances launched in the VPC.


17. How do you connect your on-premises data center to a VPC?
    Answer: Using AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect for private, secure connectivity.


18. What is the maximum number of subnets per VPC?
    Answer: By default, up to 200 subnets per VPC.


19. How do you implement high availability for NAT Gateways?
    Answer: Deploy NAT Gateways in multiple AZs and configure route tables to use the NAT Gateway in the corresponding AZ.


20. How do you handle overlapping CIDR blocks in multi-VPC architectures?
    Answer: Avoid overlapping CIDRs or use Transit Gateway with route translation; VPC Peering does not support overlapping CIDRs.


21. What are Managed Prefix Lists?
    Answer: Managed Prefix Lists are centrally managed sets of CIDR blocks that can be referenced in security groups and route tables for 
    simplified management.


22. How do you enable DNS resolution in a VPC?
    Answer: Enable both DNS resolution and DNS hostnames in the VPC settings.


23. What is the use of Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)?
    Answer: ENIs are virtual network cards that can be attached to instances, allowing multiple IP addresses and flexible networking.


24. How do you troubleshoot connectivity issues in a VPC?
    Answer: Check route tables, security groups, network ACLs, subnet configurations, and verify Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway attachments.


25. What is AWS Verified Access?
    Answer: A service that provides secure, identity-based access to applications without the need for VPNs.


26. How do you implement disaster recovery in VPC architectures?
    Answer: Use multi-region deployments, data replication, automated backups, and failover mechanisms like Route 53 health checks and Auto Scaling.


27. What is Traffic Mirroring and its use case?
    Answer: Traffic Mirroring copies network traffic from ENIs to monitoring or security appliances for deep packet inspection and troubleshooting.


28. How does AWS Network Firewall integrate with VPCs?
    Answer: It provides stateful and stateless traffic filtering at VPC level for enhanced security and compliance.


29. What are the benefits of using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with VPCs?
    Answer: IaC enables repeatable, version-controlled, and automated deployment of VPC resources, reducing errors and improving scalability.


30. How do you optimize VPC costs?
    Answer: Use appropriate instance types, leverage Auto Scaling, minimize idle resources, use NAT Gateways efficiently, and monitor usage with 
    AWS Cost Explorer.
