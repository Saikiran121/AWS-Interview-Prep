01. What is the difference between a NAT Gateway and a NAT Instance?
    Answer: NAT Gateway is a fully managed, highly available AWS service requiring no maintenance, supports bursts of bandwidth, and scales 
    automatically. NAT Instance is an EC2 instance configured to perform NAT, requires manual management, and can become a bottleneck or single 
    point of failure.


02. How does a Transit Gateway improve VPC connectivity?
    Answer: Transit Gateway acts as a central hub to connect multiple VPCs, VPNs, and on-premises networks, simplifying management and scaling by 
    reducing the number of peering connections.


03. Can you explain the difference between VPC Peering and Transit Gateway?
    Answer: VPC Peering is a one-to-one connection between two VPCs, while Transit Gateway supports many-to-many connections, enabling scalable 
    and centralized network architecture.


04. How do you troubleshoot connectivity issues between two peered VPCs?
    Answer: Check route tables in both VPCs to ensure routes to the peer CIDR are present, verify security groups and NACLs allow traffic, and 
    confirm peering connection status is active.


05. What are the limits on VPC peering connections per VPC?
    Answer: By default, you can have up to 125 active VPC peering connections per VPC.


06. How do you enable DNS resolution across peered VPCs?
    Answer: Enable the “Enable DNS resolution from peer VPC” option in the VPC peering connection settings.


07. What is the purpose of a VPC Endpoint Service (AWS PrivateLink)?
    Answer: It allows you to expose your service privately to other VPCs without using public IPs or traversing the internet.


08. What are the types of VPC endpoints?
    Answer: Interface Endpoints (powered by PrivateLink) and Gateway Endpoints (for S3 and DynamoDB).


09. How does an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) function in a VPC?
    Answer: ENI is a virtual network card that can be attached to an EC2 instance, providing multiple IP addresses, security groups, and MAC 
    addresses for flexible networking.


10. What is the difference between Security Groups and Network ACLs in terms of statefulness?
    Answer: Security Groups are stateful (return traffic is automatically allowed), while Network ACLs are stateless (return traffic must be 
    explicitly allowed).


11. How do you implement high availability for NAT Gateways?
    Answer: Deploy NAT Gateways in multiple Availability Zones and configure route tables accordingly.


12. What is the maximum number of IP addresses you can assign to a single ENI?
    Answer: Up to 50 IP addresses per ENI (varies by instance type).


13. Explain the concept of VPC Flow Logs and their use cases.
    Answer: VPC Flow Logs capture network traffic metadata for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.


14. How do you restrict access to a VPC Endpoint?
    Answer: Use endpoint policies to control which principals and actions are allowed through the endpoint.


15. What is the function of DHCP Option Sets in a VPC?
    Answer: They define DHCP parameters such as domain name servers and domain names for instances launched in the VPC.


16. How do you connect multiple on-premises sites to a single VPC?
    Answer: Use AWS VPN CloudHub to connect multiple VPN tunnels from different sites to the VPC.


17. What is AWS Verified Access and how does it relate to VPC security?
    Answer: Verified Access enables secure, identity-based access to applications without VPNs, integrating with VPC resources for granular access 
    control.


18. How does Traffic Mirroring work in a VPC?
    Answer: It copies network traffic from Elastic Network Interfaces to monitoring or security appliances for deep packet inspection.


19. What are Managed Prefix Lists and how are they used?
    Answer: Managed Prefix Lists centrally manage sets of CIDR blocks that can be referenced in security groups and route tables for simplified 
    management.


20. Can you explain the difference between a Virtual Private Gateway and a Customer Gateway?
    Answer: Virtual Private Gateway is the AWS side of a VPN connection; Customer Gateway represents the on-premises VPN device.


21. How do you enable IPv6 in a VPC?
    Answer: Assign an IPv6 CIDR block to the VPC and configure subnets and route tables to support IPv6 traffic.


22. What are the best practices for designing a multi-AZ VPC?
    Answer: Distribute subnets across AZs, deploy NAT Gateways in each AZ, and configure route tables for fault tolerance.


23. How does AWS Cloud WAN integrate with VPC networking?
    Answer: Cloud WAN provides centralized management and automation of global network connectivity, including VPCs, across regions and accounts.


24. What is the difference between a Gateway Load Balancer and a Network Load Balancer in a VPC?
    Answer: Gateway Load Balancer is used for deploying, scaling, and managing virtual appliances; Network Load Balancer handles TCP/UDP traffic 
    at high scale.


25. How do you configure VPC Peering with overlapping CIDR blocks?
    Answer: It’s not supported; you must avoid overlapping CIDRs or use Transit Gateway with route translation.


26. What is the role of Route Tables in Transit Gateway attachments?
    Answer: They control how traffic is routed between attachments (VPCs, VPNs) connected to the Transit Gateway.


27. How do you secure traffic between microservices in different VPCs?
    Answer: Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway combined with Security Groups and PrivateLink for secure, private connectivity.


28. What is the maximum number of VPCs you can attach to a Transit Gateway?
    Answer: Up to 5,000 attachments per Transit Gateway.


29. How do you enable logging for Network Firewall in a VPC?
    Answer: Configure firewall logging to send logs to CloudWatch Logs or S3 buckets.


30. How do you perform IP address management in large VPC deployments?
    Answer: Use VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) to centrally plan, track, and monitor IP address usage across VPCs and accounts.
