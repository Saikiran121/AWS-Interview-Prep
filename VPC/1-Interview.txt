01. What is a VPC?
    - A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch resources (e.g., EC2 instances) in a 
      virtual network. It provides control over IP addressing, subnets, routing, and security


02. What is the difference between a public and private subnet?
    - Public subnet: Has a route to the internet via an Internet Gateway.
    - Private subnet: No direct internet access; uses NAT Gateway/Instance for outbound traffic


03. What is a CIDR block?
    - A CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) block defines the IP address range for a VPC or subnet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)


04. What is an Internet Gateway?
    - A horizontally scaled, redundant component that allows communication between resources in a VPC and the internet


05. What is a NAT Gateway?
    - A Network Address Translation (NAT) service that enables instances in private subnets to connect to the internet while blocking inbound traffic


06. Explain Security Groups and NACLs.
    - Security Groups: Stateful, act as virtual firewalls at the instance level.
    - NACLs (Network ACLs): Stateless, operate at the subnet level


07. What is a Route Table?
    - A set of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed within a VPC


08. How many IPs does a /24 CIDR block provide?
    - 2^(32-24) = =256 IP addresses (254 usable, as AWS reserves 5)


09. What is the purpose of an Elastic IP?
    - A static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate to AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances)


10. Can a VPC have IPv6 addresses?
    - Yes. AWS supports dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) VPCs


11. What is VPC Peering?
    - A connection between two VPCs that enables private communication using private IP addresses


12. How does a Site-to-Site VPN work?
    - It establishes a secure connection between an on-premises network and a VPC using IPsec tunnels


13. What is AWS Direct Connect?
    - A dedicated network connection from your data center to AWS, bypassing the public internet


14. What is a Transit Gateway?
    - A hub that connects multiple VPCs, VPNs, and on-premises networks, simplifying network management


15. How do Security Groups differ from NACLs?
    - Security Groups are stateful (allow return traffic automatically), while NACLs are stateless (require explicit inbound/outbound rules)


16. What are VPC Flow Logs?
    - Logs capturing metadata about IP traffic flowing through network interfaces in a VPC for monitoring and troubleshooting


17. How do you restrict SSH access to an EC2 instance?
    - Configure the Security Group to allow SSH (port 22) only from specific IP ranges


18. What is a VPC Endpoint?
    - A private connection to AWS services (e.g., S3) without using an Internet Gateway


19. Explain VPC Lattice.
    - A service for automating network connectivity, security, and observability across VPCs and accounts


20. What is AWS Verified Access?
    - A service providing secure, identity-based access to applications without VPNs


21. An EC2 instance in a public subnet can’t access the internet. Why?
    - Missing route to the Internet Gateway in the route table.
    - Security Group blocking outbound traffic


22. How would you connect two VPCs in different regions?
    - Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway


23. How do you achieve high availability in a VPC?
    - Deploy resources across multiple Availability Zones and use load balancers


24. Why use multiple subnets in a VPC?
    - For fault tolerance (spread across AZs) and isolation (e.g., separating dev/prod)


25. What is the smallest CIDR block allowed for a VPC?
    - /28 (16 IPs)


26. A VPC isn’t resolving DNS. How to fix it?
    - Enable DNS hostnames and DNS resolution in the VPC settings


27. How to monitor VPC traffic?
    - Use VPC Flow Logs and Amazon CloudWatch


28. What is a default VPC?
    - A pre-configured VPC in every AWS region, with public subnets and an Internet Gateway


29. Can you modify a VPC’s CIDR block after creation?
    - No. You must create a new VPC with the desired CIDR


30. How many VPCs can you create per AWS account?
    - Soft limit of 5 VPCs per region (can be increased via support)
