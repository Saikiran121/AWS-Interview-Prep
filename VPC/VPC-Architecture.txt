01. VPC: The Virtual Network Container
    - Think of a VPC as your own private network inside AWS.
    - You define an IP address range for your VPC using CIDR notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
    - This range is the pool of IP addresses that your resources will use.


02. Subnets: Dividing the VPC
    - A subnet is a smaller segment of the VPC’s IP range.
    - Each subnet resides in a single Availability Zone (AZ).
    - You create multiple subnets to organize resources and control traffic flow.
    - Subnets are categorized as:
        a. Public Subnet: Has a route to the Internet Gateway, allowing resources to communicate with the internet.
        b. Private Subnet: No direct internet access; resources communicate internally or via NAT.


03. Route Tables: Traffic Direction
    - Route tables contain rules that determine where network traffic goes.
    - Each subnet is associated with a route table.
    - For example, a public subnet’s route table will have a route sending internet-bound traffic to the Internet Gateway.


04. Internet Gateway: Gateway to the Internet
    - An Internet Gateway (IGW) is attached to your VPC to enable communication between your VPC and the internet.
    - Only subnets with route tables pointing to the IGW become public subnets.


05. NAT Gateway/Instance: Internet Access for Private Subnets
    - Private subnets don’t have direct internet access.
    - To allow outbound internet access (for updates, patches, etc.) without exposing instances publicly, a NAT Gateway or NAT Instance is used.
    - The NAT device resides in a public subnet and forwards traffic from private subnet instances to the internet.


06. Security Groups and Network ACLs: Protecting Your Network
    - Security Groups act as virtual firewalls at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.
    - Network ACLs are stateless firewalls at the subnet level, providing an additional layer of security.
