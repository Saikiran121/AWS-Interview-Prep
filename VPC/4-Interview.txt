01. What is VPC sharing and how does it work?
    Answer: VPC sharing allows multiple AWS accounts to create resources in a centrally managed VPC. The owner account shares subnets with 
    participant accounts, enabling resource sharing without duplicating VPCs.


02. How do you implement cross-account access to VPC resources?
    Answer: Use VPC sharing, VPC peering, or AWS PrivateLink with appropriate IAM policies and security groups to enable secure cross-account 
    resource access.


03. What is the difference between AWS PrivateLink and VPC Peering?
    Answer: PrivateLink provides private connectivity to services via interface endpoints without exposing traffic to the internet or requiring 
    route table changes, while VPC Peering connects entire VPCs allowing full network-level communication.


04. Explain how VPC endpoints improve security and performance.
    Answer: VPC endpoints enable private connections to AWS services without traversing the internet, reducing exposure to threats and improving 
    latency by keeping traffic within the AWS network.


05. How can you restrict access to a VPC Endpoint?
    Answer: By attaching an endpoint policy that specifies which principals and actions are allowed or denied when accessing the endpoint.


06. What is the role of Transit Gateway route tables?
    Answer: Transit Gateway route tables control how traffic is routed between attached VPCs, VPNs, and Direct Connect gateways, enabling 
    segmentation and fine-grained control of network flows.


07. How do you handle overlapping CIDR blocks in multi-VPC architectures?
    Answer: Use Transit Gateway with route translation, or redesign CIDR allocations to avoid overlap, as VPC peering does not support overlapping 
    CIDRs.


08. What are the best practices for IP addressing in large-scale VPC deployments?
    Answer: Use hierarchical CIDR allocation, avoid overlapping ranges, leverage AWS IP Address Manager (IPAM), and plan subnets considering future 
    growth and multi-region needs.


09. How does AWS Network Firewall integrate with VPC?
    Answer: Network Firewall is deployed within VPCs to provide stateful and stateless traffic filtering, intrusion prevention, and TLS inspection, 
    protecting workloads from network threats.


10. What is the difference between stateful and stateless rules in AWS Network Firewall?
    Answer: Stateful rules track connection state and allow return traffic automatically; stateless rules evaluate packets individually without 
    maintaining session state.


11. How do you enable TLS inspection in AWS Network Firewall?
    Answer: By configuring TLS inspection rules and providing certificates for decrypting and inspecting encrypted traffic passing through the 
    firewall.


12. What is the function of AWS Firewall Manager in managing VPC security?
    Answer: Firewall Manager centrally manages firewall rules, security groups, and AWS WAF policies across multiple accounts and resources for 
    consistent security posture.


13. How do you architect a highly available NAT solution in AWS?
    Answer: Deploy NAT Gateways in multiple AZs and update route tables to route private subnet traffic to the NAT Gateway in the same AZ for fault 
    tolerance.


14. What are the limitations of NAT Gateways?
    Answer: NAT Gateways only support IPv4, have hourly charges, and cannot be assigned to a specific instance or have custom firewall rules.


15. How do you use VPC Flow Logs for security auditing?
    Answer: Capture and analyze network traffic metadata to detect unusual patterns, unauthorized access attempts, or data exfiltration.


16. What is the difference between ClassicLink and VPC?
    Answer: ClassicLink connects EC2-Classic instances to a VPC, allowing them to communicate using private IPs; VPC is the modern isolated virtual 
    network environment.


17. How do you configure multi-region VPC connectivity?
    Answer: Use inter-region VPC Peering or Transit Gateway with inter-region peering enabled to connect VPCs across AWS regions.


18. Explain the concept of VPC traffic mirroring and its use cases.
    Answer: Traffic Mirroring copies network traffic from ENIs to monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection, troubleshooting, and security 
    analysis.


19. How do you secure data in transit within a VPC?
    Answer: Use encryption protocols like TLS, IPsec VPNs, and AWS PrivateLink to ensure data is encrypted while moving between resources.


20. What are the implications of enabling DNS hostnames and DNS resolution in a VPC?
    Answer: Enables instances to resolve AWS service endpoints and internal hostnames, essential for service discovery and communication.


21. How do you troubleshoot “Instance unreachable” issues in a VPC?
    Answer: Verify subnet route tables, security groups, network ACLs, instance status, and ensure the correct IP addressing and internet gateway 
    attachment.


22. What is the use of Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) in a VPC?
    Answer: EFA provides low-latency, high-throughput networking for HPC and machine learning workloads within a VPC.


23. How do you implement service mesh architectures within VPCs?
    Answer: Use AWS App Mesh or third-party service meshes with PrivateLink and VPC peering to enable secure, observable service-to-service 
    communication.


24. What is the role of AWS Global Accelerator with VPCs?
    Answer: It provides static IP addresses and optimizes routing to improve availability and performance of applications deployed in multiple 
    VPCs or regions.


25. How do you manage VPC quotas and request increases?
    Answer: Monitor limits via AWS Service Quotas and request limit increases through AWS Support when needed.


26. Explain how you would migrate an on-premises network to AWS VPC.
    Answer: Plan IP addressing, establish VPN or Direct Connect, replicate network segmentation using subnets and security groups, and migrate 
    workloads incrementally.


27. How do you secure inter-VPC communication?
    Answer: Use Transit Gateway with security policies, VPC Peering with strict security groups, or PrivateLink for service-specific access.


28. What is the significance of the “Source/Destination Check” attribute on an EC2 instance?
    Answer: Disabling it is necessary for instances acting as NAT or routers to forward traffic not destined for themselves.


29. How do you implement centralized logging for multiple VPCs?
    Answer: Use VPC Flow Logs aggregated into a central S3 bucket or CloudWatch Logs group, possibly via AWS Organizations and Firewall Manager.


30. What are the security considerations when enabling IPv6 in a VPC?
    Answer: Ensure security groups and NACLs are configured for IPv6, monitor IPv6 traffic with flow logs, and understand that IPv6 traffic 
    bypasses NAT.
