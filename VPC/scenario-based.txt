01. Scenario: You launched EC2 instances in the same VPC but they cannot communicate with each other using private IPs. What could be the issue?
    Answer: By default, instances in the same VPC can communicate via private IPs. If communication fails, check Security Groups and Network ACLs 
    to ensure they allow inbound/outbound traffic on required ports.


02. Scenario: You want to design a highly available 2-tier web application in AWS. How would you architect the VPC?
    Answer: Create public subnets with Internet Gateway for load balancers and private subnets for application servers across multiple Availability 
    Zones. Use Auto Scaling groups and route tables accordingly.


03. Scenario: You need to restrict outbound internet access for one subnet but allow it for another in the same VPC. How?
    Answer: Modify the route table of the restricted subnet to remove the default route to the Internet Gateway, while keeping it for the other 
    subnet.


04. Scenario: You want to isolate sensitive workloads within your VPC. How do you create an isolated subnet?
    Answer: Create a subnet without a route to an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway, ensuring no inbound or outbound internet access.


05. Scenario: Your application needs to access S3 securely without using the internet. How do you achieve this?
    Answer: Create a Gateway VPC Endpoint for S3, allowing private communication between your VPC and S3.


06. Scenario: How would you differentiate between Security Groups and Network ACLs in securing your VPC?
    Answer: Use Security Groups for instance-level stateful filtering and Network ACLs for subnet-level stateless filtering, providing layered 
    security.


07. Scenario: Your EC2 instances in a public subnet are not reachable from the internet. What could be wrong?
    Answer: Check if the subnetâ€™s route table has a route to the Internet Gateway, if the instances have public IPs, and if Security Groups allow 
    inbound traffic.


08. Scenario: You want to assign a static public IP to an EC2 instance. How?
    Answer: Allocate and associate an Elastic IP address to the instance.


09. Scenario: How do you enable DNS resolution for instances in your VPC?
    Answer: Enable DNS resolution and DNS hostnames in the VPC settings.


10. Scenario: You want to monitor network traffic in your VPC. What AWS service do you use?
    Answer: Enable VPC Flow Logs to capture metadata about IP traffic.


11. Scenario: You have multiple VPCs and want them to communicate privately. What options do you have?
    Answer: Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway to enable private communication between VPCs.


12. Scenario: You want to connect your on-premises data center to AWS VPC securely. What are your options?
    Answer: Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect.


13. Scenario: How do you implement high availability for NAT gateways?
    Answer: Deploy NAT Gateways in multiple Availability Zones and update route tables accordingly.


14. Scenario: You need to allow instances in private subnets to access AWS services without internet access. How?
    Answer: Use Interface VPC Endpoints (AWS PrivateLink) for private connectivity to AWS services.


15. Scenario: Your VPC has overlapping CIDR blocks with another VPC you want to peer with. What can you do?
    Answer: VPC Peering does not support overlapping CIDR blocks; consider redesigning CIDRs or using Transit Gateway with route translation.


16. Scenario: How do you restrict access to a VPC Endpoint?
    Answer: Attach an endpoint policy specifying allowed principals and actions.


17. Scenario: You want to log and analyze all inbound and outbound traffic to your VPC. How?
    Answer: Use VPC Flow Logs and send them to CloudWatch Logs or S3 for analysis.


18. Scenario: How do you troubleshoot EC2 instances in a private subnet that cannot access the internet?
    Answer: Verify NAT Gateway presence, route table entries for private subnet, and Security Group rules.


19. Scenario: How can you securely expose a service running in your VPC to other VPCs or accounts?
    Answer: Use AWS PrivateLink with VPC Endpoint Services.


20. Scenario: You want to automate VPC creation and resource provisioning. What tools do you use?
    Answer: Use AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CDK for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).


21. Scenario: You want to design a multi-region VPC architecture with secure and scalable connectivity. How?
    Answer: Use inter-region VPC Peering or Transit Gateway with inter-region peering enabled, combined with encrypted VPN or Direct Connect.


22. Scenario: How do you implement centralized security controls across multiple VPCs and accounts?
    Answer: Use AWS Firewall Manager to centrally manage security groups, Network Firewall, and WAF policies.


23. Scenario: You want to perform deep packet inspection on VPC traffic. How?
    Answer: Use Traffic Mirroring to send traffic to monitoring appliances.


24. Scenario: How do you handle IP address management at scale across multiple VPCs?
    Answer: Use AWS VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) to plan, track, and audit IP allocations.


25. Scenario: Your application requires encrypted traffic inspection within the VPC. How do you achieve this?
    Answer: Use AWS Network Firewall with TLS inspection configurations.


26. Scenario: You want to provide zero-trust access to applications hosted in your VPC without using VPNs. What service do you use?
    Answer: Use AWS Verified Access to enable identity-based access.


27. Scenario: How do you ensure compliance requirements like PCI-DSS or HIPAA in your VPC design?
    Answer: Implement strict Security Groups and NACLs, enable logging (Flow Logs, CloudTrail), encrypt data at rest and in transit, and use AWS 
    Config for compliance auditing.


28. Scenario: You want to connect multiple on-premises sites to a single VPC. How?
    Answer: Use AWS VPN CloudHub to connect multiple VPN tunnels from different sites.


29. Scenario: How do you secure microservices communication across multiple VPCs?
    Answer: Use VPC Peering or Transit Gateway combined with PrivateLink and fine-grained Security Group rules.


30. Scenario: You need to migrate workloads from EC2-Classic to VPC. What considerations do you have?
    Answer: Plan IP addressing, security groups, and routing; use ClassicLink to connect EC2-Classic instances to VPC during migration; ensure 
    compatibility of applications.
